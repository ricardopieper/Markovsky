# Markovsky
A toy program that generates text based on a simple dictionary of occurrences. And NGrams.

NgramMarkovChain has 2 parameters: file and ngramSize. Training file is https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/trump-speeches, and ngramSize controls how trumpy the sentences are. If you set to 10, it's basically Trump itself. If you set to 2, it's kinda random but funny.
